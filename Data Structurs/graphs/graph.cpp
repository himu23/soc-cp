//graphs are very versatile data structures used to model relationships between entites. they consists of nodes(vertices) and edges. 
//Graphs can be directed (edges have a specific direction) or undirected (edges have no direction).
//Graphs can also be weighted (edges have associated values) or unweighted.

//undirected (or bidirectional graph)
//directed (digraph/ unidirectional graph)

//connected graph: is a grph in which there exista a path between every pair of nodes. in other words;
//disconnected graph: atleast two nodes without a path connecting them;

//weighted graph: is a graph in which each edge has an associated numerical value or weight.

//tree(a graph without cycles): connected(all the nodes are connected by edges, and there is a unique path between any pair of nodes);
//      acyclic(there are no cycles or closed loops in the graph);

//forest: is a collection of disjoint trees, it consista of one or more trees;

//maximum edges in a connected graph: nc2;


//three common representations are the adjacency matrix, adjacency list, and edge list;

//bipartite graph: whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets;
//U and V that is, every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.
