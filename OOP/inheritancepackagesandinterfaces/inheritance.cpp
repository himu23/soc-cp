//inheritance allows you to create a new class (called a subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (called a base class or parent class).
/*
    Base Class (Parent Class):
        The base class is the class from which other classes inherit properties and behaviors.
        It serves as the template or blueprint for creating derived classes.
    Derived Class (Child Class or Subclass):
        The derived class is a new class created by inheriting properties and behaviors from a base class.
        It can add new attributes and methods in addition to those inherited from the base class.

/*C++ supports five types of inheritance:

    Single inheritance
    Multiple inheritance
    Hierarchical inheritance
    Multilevel inheritance
    Hybrid inheritance
